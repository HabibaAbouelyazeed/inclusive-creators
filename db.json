      "content": "Autism is a developmental disorder with symptoms that appear within the first three years of life. Its formal diagnostic name is autism spectrum disorder. The word 'spectrum' indicates that autism appears in different forms with varying levels of severity. That means that each individual with autism experiences their own unique strengths, symptoms, and challenges. Understanding more about ASD can help you better understand the individuals who are living with it. How autism spectrum disorders are described Psychiatrists and other clinicians rely on the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to define autism and its symptoms. The DSM-5 definition recognizes two main symptom areas:\n\nDeficits in social communication and interaction\nRestricted, repetitive behaviors, interests, or activities\nThese symptoms appear early in a child’s development—although diagnosis may occur later. Autism is diagnosed when symptoms cause developmental challenges that are not better explained by other conditions.\n\nThe definition of autism has been refined over the years. Between 1995 and 2011, the DSM-IV grouped Asperger’s Syndrome and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) with autism. Asperger’s syndrome was an autism spectrum disorder marked by strong verbal language skills and, often, high intellectual ability. PDD-NOS was a more general diagnosis for people who did not fit clearly into the other two categories.\n\nHowever, the DSM-5 no longer recognizes Asperger’s syndrome or PDD-NOS as separate diagnoses. Individuals who would previously have received either of these diagnoses may now receive a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder instead.",

      "body": "Occupational therapists work with autistic children and adults to help them better perform activities of daily living. Occupational therapy is one of the three most commonly offered therapies in the school setting (along with speech therapy and behavioral therapy); occupational therapists may work toward a huge range of goals, from better handwriting to play skills to sensory integration.",
      "content": "Have people with disabilities been included in the art communities before?\nThe quick answer – yes! But, not as much as we’d like to think. \n\nA recent report by the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California indicates that less than 3% of characters in the 100 highest-earning movies of 2016 had disabilities. A 2018 report from the Ruderman Foundation showed that disability representation on television is equally underwhelming – of all of the TV characters that year with disabilities, only 12% were played by actors with disabilities.\n\nActors with disabilities are constantly demonstrating that they have the talent, skill, and ability to engage with non-disabled performers on stage and onscreen. Writers with disabilities are writing new plays based on their own life experiences. Directors with disabilities are taking the helm of companies who want their work to be creative responses to modern life. Designers with disabilities are producing sets that not only contribute to the storytelling but also enhance the audience experience. \n\nBut while actors with disabilities and disability inclusion in the arts are making great strides, we have to admit that there is still a long way to go. In fact, according to another recent report by the Ruderman Family Foundation, 95% of the time, actors without disabilities portray the roles of disabled actors when, in reality, many disabled actors can fill that role just as well – or even better!\n\nEven if there is still a lot to work on, we can certainly see that big changes for art and disabilities are on the horizon. In a KIT blog posted in August of 2019, for instance, it was our pleasure to shine a well-deserved spotlight on The National Disability Theatre (NDT), whose mission is to raise the bar of inclusion in professional theaters. And when NDT founders Talleri McRae and Mickey Rowe came to our KIT Summer Intensive to tell us about their vision, we were all blown away! The changes they seek are long overdue and clearly life-transforming.\n\nThen, we have Hollywood and big industry names like Paramount Pictures that fully support inclusion in the arts. NBCUniversal vowed to hold more auditions for actors with disabilities, and two prolific actresses, Taraji P. Henson & Octavia Spencer, have respectively made waves in the movement towards inclusion in the arts. Taraji was recently awarded the Morton E. Ruderman Award in Inclusion, while Octavia has called for a more authentic on-screen representation of people with disabilities in various recent interviews.\n\nTheater and the arts are vibrant social spaces where people gather to explore their humanity. Acting, visual arts, playwriting, singing, and dance help us expand our perspective and see the world in a new way. People – artists and audiences alike – gather inside these theaters to share an experience and (hopefully) leave with a better understanding of themselves and each other. So there is no justifiable reason why those with disabilities should be excluded from basking in the glow of a beautiful theater production, art exhibit, or from participating in plays, performances, or films.",

They have a wide range of skills and may work in any setting—from a hospital or clinic to a school, home, or community setting.\n\nTheir general focus is on improving the client's ability to participate in activities of daily living, but those activities may include anything from schoolwork to play to toothbrushing.\n\nWhy Occupational Therapists Work With Autistic Children\nOccupational therapists often work with children who have physical challenges resulting from disorders such as cerebral palsy or traumatic brain injury. Autistic children may not have major physical disabilities, but many are struggling with specific challenges including:\n\n- Low motor tone (weak muscles)\n- Sensory dysfunction (too much or too little response to touch, sound, light, smell, or taste)\n- Difficulty with motor planning (lack of coordination)\n- Lack of imitative skills that help neurotypical children learn play skills and skills of daily living\n- Lack of social skills that help neurotypical children learn how to engage in physical activities in a group setting\n\nAll of these challenges can be addressed (though rarely cured) through different forms of occupational therapy. Occupational therapists who work with autistic children may specialize in (for example) play therapy, handwriting therapy, sensory integration therapy, social skills therapy, or even behavioral therapy.",

      "content": "While ADHD is believed to be hereditary, effectively managing your child’s symptoms can affect both the severity of the disorder and development of more serious problems over time. Early intervention holds the key to positive outcomes for your child. The earlier you address your child’s problems, the more likely you will be able to prevent school and social failure and associated problems such as underachievement and poor self-esteem that may lead to delinquency or drug and alcohol abuse. Although life with your child may at times seem challenging, as a parent you can help create home and school environments that improve your child’s chances for success.\n\nHere are some ways to get started:\n\n1. Don’t waste your limited emotional energy on self-blame. ADHD is a disorder in certain areas of the brain and is inherited in the majority of cases. It is not caused by poor parenting or a chaotic home environment, although the home environment can make the symptoms of ADHD better or worse.\n2. Learn all you can about ADHD. While a great deal of information on the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD is available, not all of it is accurate or based on scientific evidence. It is up to you to be a good consumer and learn to distinguish the accurate information from the inaccurate. How can you sort out what will be useful and what will not? In general, it is good to be wary about ads claiming to cure ADHD. Currently, there is no cure for ADHD, but you can take positive steps to decrease its impact. In addition, pay attention to the source of the information. If you’re using the Internet, stick with reputable websites such as government (for example CDC), nonprofit (such as CHADD) or university resources (those that end in .edu).\n3. Make sure your child has a comprehensive assessment. To complete the diagnostic process, make sure your child has a comprehensive assessment that includes medical, educational and psychological evaluations (involving input from your child’s teacher) and that other disorders that either mimic or commonly occur with ADHD have been considered and ruled out.",

How can parents deal with the financial burden that comes with the myriad of services the child needs?\n\nHere are some challenges you may face parenting a child with a disability and a few suggestions on how to deal with those challenges.",
      "content": "When parents don’t agree:\n\nThe diagnosis process has different stages of acceptance, understanding, and grief. Parents are coping with their emotions, and their partners may feel differently. That can be incredibly upsetting, frustrating, and heartbreaking to navigate as a couple. There is so much mental and physical energy exerted on parenting. When a child has an exceptionality or disability that requires research, medical care, appointments, and services, there are additional stressors. Scheduling and attending appointments for the child can be physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially draining. Resentments and strain in the parents’ relationship can form when expectations of each person’s roles and responsibilities are not communicated and met.\n\nA source of contention in a relationship can be parents disagreeing on medical decisions and services. Challenges include not agreeing on whether or not the child should take medication and what services to prioritize. An example would be one parent focusing on academic support such as tutoring while the other believes services such as occupational or speech therapy are what the child needs.\n\nHaving parents attend the school’s 504 or IEP meetings and medical appointments is important so they can discuss concerns, gather feedback, and make informed decisions. When one parent attends the meetings and therapy sessions alone, they can often feel the weight of shouldering the responsibility and summarizing what happened in the appointments, and relaying medical terminology can be frustrating. If work or transportation barriers prevent a parent from attending, request if virtual meetings are an option.\n\nThere are situations where some parents and family members will not accept a child’s diagnosis; whether it be a perceived shame, cultural stereotypes, unconscious biases, and lack of understanding, education, and empathy, some people will not be able to support their child and their needs. While this can impact blood-relative relationships, do not underestimate the powerful bonds built by educators, therapists, and friends who support your child with care, compassion, and love.",
