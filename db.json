      "content": "Autism is a developmental disorder with symptoms that appear within the first three years of life. Its formal diagnostic name is autism spectrum disorder. The word 'spectrum' indicates that autism appears in different forms with varying levels of severity. That means that each individual with autism experiences their own unique strengths, symptoms, and challenges. Understanding more about ASD can help you better understand the individuals who are living with it. How autism spectrum disorders are described Psychiatrists and other clinicians rely on the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to define autism and its symptoms. The DSM-5 definition recognizes two main symptom areas:\n\nDeficits in social communication and interaction\nRestricted, repetitive behaviors, interests, or activities\nThese symptoms appear early in a child’s development—although diagnosis may occur later. Autism is diagnosed when symptoms cause developmental challenges that are not better explained by other conditions.\n\nThe definition of autism has been refined over the years. Between 1995 and 2011, the DSM-IV grouped Asperger’s Syndrome and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) with autism. Asperger’s syndrome was an autism spectrum disorder marked by strong verbal language skills and, often, high intellectual ability. PDD-NOS was a more general diagnosis for people who did not fit clearly into the other two categories.\n\nHowever, the DSM-5 no longer recognizes Asperger’s syndrome or PDD-NOS as separate diagnoses. Individuals who would previously have received either of these diagnoses may now receive a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder instead.",

      "content": "What Is an Occupational Therapist?\nOccupational therapists are individuals who have completed a master's degree and received a license to practice. They have a wide range of skills and may work in any setting—from a hospital or clinic to a school, home, or community setting.\n\nTheir general focus is on improving the client's ability to participate in activities of daily living, but those activities may include anything from schoolwork to play to toothbrushing.\n\nWhy Occupational Therapists Work With Autistic Children\nOccupational therapists often work with children who have physical challenges resulting from disorders such as cerebral palsy or traumatic brain injury. Autistic children may not have major physical disabilities, but many are struggling with specific challenges including:\n\n- Low motor tone (weak muscles)\n- Sensory dysfunction (too much or too little response to touch, sound, light, smell, or taste)\n- Difficulty with motor planning (lack of coordination)\n- Lack of imitative skills that help neurotypical children learn play skills and skills of daily living\n- Lack of social skills that help neurotypical children learn how to engage in physical activities in a group setting\n\nAll of these challenges can be addressed (though rarely cured) through different forms of occupational therapy. Occupational therapists who work with autistic children may specialize in (for example) play therapy, handwriting therapy, sensory integration therapy, social skills therapy, or even behavioral therapy.",

So, whether you’re an accessibility practitioner, theater or art student, or just part of a school or community theater looking to be more inclusive of those with disabilities, this blog will introduce you to the topic of disability inclusion in the arts and link out to useful KIT resources that can be helpful for anyone working to expand access to the arts for those with disabilities",
      "content": "While ADHD is believed to be hereditary, effectively managing your child’s symptoms can affect both the severity of the disorder and development of more serious problems over time. Early intervention holds the key to positive outcomes for your child. The earlier you address your child’s problems, the more likely you will be able to prevent school and social failure and associated problems such as underachievement and poor self-esteem that may lead to delinquency or drug and alcohol abuse. Although life with your child may at times seem challenging, as a parent you can help create home and school environments that improve your child’s chances for success.\n\nHere are some ways to get started:\n\n1. Don’t waste your limited emotional energy on self-blame. ADHD is a disorder in certain areas of the brain and is inherited in the majority of cases. It is not caused by poor parenting or a chaotic home environment, although the home environment can make the symptoms of ADHD better or worse.\n2. Learn all you can about ADHD. While a great deal of information on the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD is available, not all of it is accurate or based on scientific evidence. It is up to you to be a good consumer and learn to distinguish the accurate information from the inaccurate. How can you sort out what will be useful and what will not? In general, it is good to be wary about ads claiming to cure ADHD. Currently, there is no cure for ADHD, but you can take positive steps to decrease its impact. In addition, pay attention to the source of the information. If you’re using the Internet, stick with reputable websites such as government (for example CDC), nonprofit (such as CHADD) or university resources (those that end in .edu).\n3. Make sure your child has a comprehensive assessment. To complete the diagnostic process, make sure your child has a comprehensive assessment that includes medical, educational and psychological evaluations (involving input from your child’s teacher) and that other disorders that either mimic or commonly occur with ADHD have been considered and ruled out.",

      "body": "Parenthood presents challenges for all families but the complexities of raising children with disabilities and those who are neurodivergent can include additional stressors. For instance, what happens when parents disagree about a child’s diagnosis, medical decisions, and services? How can parents deal with the financial burden that comes with the myriad of services the child needs?\n\nHere are some challenges you may face parenting a child with a disability and a few suggestions on how to deal with those challenges.",
      "content": "When parents don’t agree:\n\nThe diagnosis process has different stages of acceptance, understanding, and grief. Parents are coping with their emotions, and their partners may feel differently. That can be incredibly upsetting, frustrating, and heartbreaking to navigate as a couple. There is so much mental and physical energy exerted on parenting. When a child has an exceptionality or disability that requires research, medical care, appointments, and services, there are additional stressors. Scheduling and attending appointments for the child can be physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially draining. Resentments and strain in the parents’ relationship can form when expectations of each person’s roles and responsibilities are not communicated and met.\n\nA source of contention in a relationship can be parents disagreeing on medical decisions and services. Challenges include not agreeing on whether or not the child should take medication and what services to prioritize. An example would be one parent focusing on academic support such as tutoring while the other believes services such as occupational or speech therapy are what the child needs.\n\nHaving parents attend the school’s 504 or IEP meetings and medical appointments is important so they can discuss concerns, gather feedback, and make informed decisions. When one parent attends the meetings and therapy sessions alone, they can often feel the weight of shouldering the responsibility and summarizing what happened in the appointments, and relaying medical terminology can be frustrating. If work or transportation barriers prevent a parent from attending, request if virtual meetings are an option.\n\nThere are situations where some parents and family members will not accept a child’s diagnosis; whether it be a perceived shame, cultural stereotypes, unconscious biases, and lack of understanding, education, and empathy, some people will not be able to support their child and their needs. While this can impact blood-relative relationships, do not underestimate the powerful bonds built by educators, therapists, and friends who support your child with care, compassion, and love.",

      "content": "Inclusive education involves teaching all students in the same age-appropriate general education classroom at their local school, regardless of the challenges they face. The philosophy of inclusive education promotes the idea that students with disabilities are just as competent as students without disabilities. Successful inclusive education for students with disabilities involves accepting their differences, ensuring they feel supported and encouraging them to participate fully in the classroom.\n\nTake a look at the benefits of inclusive education and what strategies teachers can use to ensure classrooms are welcoming and accessible to all students. Research shows that students without special needs also benefit from learning alongside those with special needs, developing both their cognitive and social abilities. This is generally because inclusive classrooms can enable new learning opportunities to emerge. Serving as a peer coach, for instance, can enable students without special needs to improve their own academic performance by helping others learn.\n\nClassroom teachers can start by providing instruction using learning modalities that cater to a diverse range of learners, which should end up benefiting all students in a general classroom.",
